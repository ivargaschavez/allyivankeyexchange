Question #1
Describe the protocol you agreed upon with your classmates in English (no code) in
enough detail that someone else could implement it. 

Our class agreed upon using the DH Key exchange and having the server first generate a
public key to send to client and then the client generate its public key and send it to 
the server. We agreed we would need to store these keys somewhere in the code so we can 
use them later in the process_user_input and process_recieved_message functions. 
Next we agreed upon creating a byte string of the ciphertext tag adn nonce and separating them
using delimiters so we know what part of the incoming message to give to AES as the nonce and tag.
Then, we agreed upon using AES EAX cipher mode for our encryption after a classmate said it 
provides both confidentiality and integrity.

Question #2
Describe two pros of the protocol you agreed upon with your classmates.

One pro of the protocol we agreed upon was using EAX mode because it provides HMAC for
authentication. We did not have to implement HMAC because of this. In addition, during our diffie-helman key
exchange algorithm me and my classmates agreed that our handshake will involve the server sending the key to client first and then the client to server. The pro of this is that the client will know the server works and this protects the client/

Question #3
Describe two cons of the protocol you agreed upon with your classmates.

One con of the protocol we agreed with our classmate was how to send information. For example, we are supposed to send over the ciphertext, tag, and nonce respectively. We had to decide which data structure to use like bytes, string or json. The wide availibity of options made this protocol hard. Another, con is that the protocol makes it relevant we have limited bytes to work with and the order and size of our ciphertext, tag, and nonce greatly affects the secure messaging system.

Question #4
Thinking like a defender, what/who do you have to trust in order to be confident
that messages sent using your SecureMessaging.py cannot be obtained by an adversary and why? 
Describe at least THREE entities you must trust.  

Three entities we must trust are the authors of AES Cipher and pyDH because they are the 
foundation of our confidentiality and integrity of the program. Lastly, we also have to trust 
our partner (if we did work with partners). We must trust that the partner will not do any malicious
coding to the program or give away our protocol to others that want to try and break it.

Question #5
Thinking like an attacker, how might an adversary still compromise the confidentiality or 
integrity of a message sent to a classmate using your SecureMessaging.py? 
Describe at least TWO potential attacks. 

An adversary can still compromise the confidentiality or intergrity of a message by simply
looking over one's shoulder and reading the messages unencoded.

Question #6 (ungraded)
How did you divide the work between partners? (Put N/A if worked alone)

We created a git repository and we would first talk over zoom about
what we want to accomplish. One of us would code and commit. Next, the other partner
would help debug. Then this went on for each function, changing up who was the first to code
and who would debug and add code that would make functions work.

Did you use code snippets from anywhere online that you need to cite?

No
